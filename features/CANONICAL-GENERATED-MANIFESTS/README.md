The files in this directory are the output of canonical manifest generators. They
should never be edited by hand and should generally never be replaced. If the manifest
feature version changes, a new canonical example should be added, identifying the
version.

Filenames should follow the pattern: `{FEATURE NAME}.v{FEATURE VERSION}.json`
