## Summary

Test vector manifests are used within this framework to define how to evaluate or generate certain test
vectors. When multiple manifests are present in a single location it is helpful to be able to
identify groups of manifests that should be processed together.

A meta-manifest is a file identifying one or more additional manifests and their types.

## Out of Scope

This file is not a definition of any other manifest types.

## Motivation

It is helpful to have a single entry point for all test vectors. Every manifest contains sufficient
information for a client to process it with no additional information, but a meta-manifest provides
a single reference point for all manifests within a given test set.

## Guide-level Explanation

A meta-manifest is a JSON document that identifies the location and type of one or more test
case manifests. It is used to enumerate all manifests to use for a given test set. Each manifest
is identified by type and a URI is specified from which the manifest can be obtained.

## Reference-level Explanation

### Contents

#### manifest

Map identifying the manifest.

-   `type` : Identifies the manifest as a meta-manifest.
    -   Must be `meta`
-   `version` : Identifies the version of this feature document that describes the manifest.

#### tests

List of references to additional manifests.

Each reference is a JSON object that must contain the following members:

-   `manifest` : URI that maps to a valid manifest.
-   `type` : Type identifier for the specified manifest.
    -   This must be the `type` value for the manifest in question.

### Example

```json
{
    "manifest": {
        "type": "meta",
        "version": 1
    },
    "tests": [
        {
            "manifest": "file://relative/file/path.json",
            "type": "example-manifest"
        },
        {
            "manifest": "s3://example/key/path.json",
            "type": "example-manifest"
        },
        {
            "manifest": "https://example.com/manifests/example.json",
            "type": "example-manifest"
        }
    ]
}
```
